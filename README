PDF/Extract version 1.02
========================

PDF Extract is a group of methods that allow the user to quickly grab pages
as a new PDF document from a pre-existing multi page PDF document.

With PDF::Extract a new PDF document can be.
    assigned to a scalar variable with getPDFExtract.
    saved to disk with savePDFExtract.
    printed to STDOUT as a PDF web document with servePDFExtract.
    cached and served for a faster PDF web document service with fastServePDFExtract.
    
These four main methods can be called with or without arguments. The methods 
will not work unless they know the location of the original PDF document and the 
pages to extract. There are no default values.

As little as 3 lines of code can serve a dynamic PDF web document
use PDF::Extract;
$pdf = new PDF::Extract( PDFDoc =>"/docs/my.pdf", PDFPages =>"1-3 7"  ) ;
$pdf->servePDFExtract;
